The Capstone started the week of Oct 5th, 2014 with the final submission due November 30th, 2014.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I am very honored and grateful that my peers voted my app as one of the top apps in this Specialization. Thank you.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you like statistics : According the <a href=\"https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/MoCCA-Capstone/wiki/MoCCA-Capstone-FAQ\">FAQ (#36)</a> <quote>The top 30 apps will consist of the top 10 apps from each project (Potlatch, Mutibo, and Symptoms Management).</quote></p>\r\n<p> Final peer review evaluation for this specific project was 100% or 44/44 points.</p>\r\n<p>The deliverables included this app along with a Java Spring Server.  The server source for this project can be found at : </p>\r\n<p><a href=https://github.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementServer>https://github.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementServer</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Capstone MOOC gives Signature Track students who passed all previous MOOCs in the MoCCA Specialization “with Distinction” an opportunity to integrate and demonstrate the knowledge they acquired across the three earlier content area MOOCs. Participation in this Capstone course was by invitation only.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a href=https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2?utm_medium=courseDescripLabel>https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2?utm_medium=courseDescripLabel</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\nCourse 1 Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems (5200 students met the \"distinction\" criteria.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCourse 2 Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems (3,600 students met the \"distinction\" criteria.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCourse 3 Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems (no statistics given)\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Statistics related to the Symptom Management project.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n364 students created a mid-term design for the Symptom Management project. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n57% of these submitted a final Symptom Management project or ~208 students.

During this time, symptoms can flare suddenly. The worst\r\nsymptom for patients is radiation-induced oral pain and sore throat. Between the 2nd\r\nand 4th week of treatment, pain may increase from nothing to severe (i.e., “I’m\r\nswallowing glass”) in a matter of days. Once the pain has escalated to this point,\r\npatients stop eating and drinking and often must undergo a surgical procedure for the\r\nplacement of a feeding tube.\r\nWeek to week, doctors rely largely on a patient’s memory to intervene and manage\r\nsymptoms, but patient recall is notoriously unreliable, and weekly visits can leave\r\nsymptoms sub-optimally managed for days.\r\n“Symptom Management” is a smartphone-based application which provides a more\r\nreliable method to assess symptoms in near real-time. It provides patients a simple way\r\nto work with their healthcare providers to improve management of pain and quality of care.</p>\r\n======================\r\n<p>\r\n <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/doc/Final%2520SMA%2520Design%2520Document.pdf\">Final Functional Requirements Design Document (Detailed PDF)</a>\r\n<br></p>\r\n======================\r\n<p><a href=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/doc/symptom%2520management%2520final%252011-30.mp4\">Final Video with App Usage - Suggested listening speed >1X best at 2X ;-}</a>\r\n<br></p>\r\n======================\r\nFEEDBACK FROM PEER REVIEWS\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/ReviewsImage.PNG\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p> <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/doc/FEEDBACK.pdf\">PDF print of Full Itemized Peer Review Evaluation 12-13-2014</a>\r\n<br></p>\r\n======================\r\n<p><strong>Below are examples of screens from the app.  Please see the <a href=\"dhttps://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/doc/Final%2520SMA%2520Design%2520Document.pdf\">Final Functional Requirements Design Document</a> for more screen images.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> Example of Patient Screens</strong> </p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/checkin 1.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/patient history log.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/track pain.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/patient meds list phone.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n======================\r\n<p><strong>  Example of Doctor Screens</strong> </p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/dr dashboard nexus sever patient.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/dr dashboard pie chart nexus.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/dr patient bar chart nexus.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"><br></p>\r\n======================\r\n<p><strong>  Example of Administrator Screens</strong> </p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/admin add patient nexus.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/admin patient edit phone.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://rawgit.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp/master/images/admin patient list phone.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"><br></p>\r\n======================\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014 Sky Woman Technology LLC\r\n    \r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. \r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and \r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
