<p>
This is the Android app for the Capstone project course in the Coursera Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization, which is the first Capstone course offered on the Coursera platform.  The Capstone started the week of Oct 5th, 2014 with the final submission due November 30th, 2014.</p>
<p>The deliverables included this app along with a Java Spring Server.  The server source for this project can be found at : </p>

<p>
The Capstone MOOC gives Signature Track students who passed all previous MOOCs in the MoCCA Specialization “with Distinction” an opportunity to integrate and demonstrate the knowledge they acquired across the three earlier content area MOOCs. Participation in this Capstone course was by invitation only.

<strong>Project Description:</strong>
Over half of head and neck cancer patients will receive chemotherapy and radiation
therapy for 6-7 weeks. During this time, symptoms can flare suddenly. The worst
symptom for patients is radiation-induced oral pain and sore throat. Between the 2nd
and 4th week of treatment, pain may increase from nothing to severe (i.e., “I’m
swallowing glass”) in a matter of days. Once the pain has escalated to this point,
patients stop eating and drinking and often must undergo a surgical procedure for the
placement of a feeding tube.
Week to week, doctors rely largely on a patient’s memory to intervene and manage
symptoms, but patient recall is notoriously unreliable, and weekly visits can leave
symptoms sub-optimally managed for days.
“Symptom Management” is a smartphone-based application which provides a more
reliable method to assess symptoms in near real-time. It provides patients a simple way
to work with their healthcare providers to improve management of pain and quality of
care.<br></p>
