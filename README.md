Project Description:
Over half of head and neck cancer patients will receive chemotherapy and radiation
therapy for 6-7 weeks. During this time, symptoms can flare suddenly. The worst
symptom for patients is radiation-induced oral pain and sore throat. Between the 2nd
and 4th week of treatment, pain may increase from nothing to severe (i.e., “I’m
swallowing glass”) in a matter of days. Once the pain has escalated to this point,
patients stop eating and drinking and often must undergo a surgical procedure for the
placement of a feeding tube.
Week to week, doctors rely largely on a patient’s memory to intervene and manage
symptoms, but patient recall is notoriously unreliable, and weekly visits can leave
symptoms sub-optimally managed for days.
“Symptom Management” is a smartphone-based application which provides a more
reliable method to assess symptoms in near real-time. It provides patients a simple way
to work with their healthcare providers to improve management of pain and quality of
care.<br></p>
